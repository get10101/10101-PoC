### Problems âœ‹

- Time is a critical factor at this point, as the deadline is closing in and quite a lot left to do. This may give us not enough time to iterate over design proposals. see also our [Legends of Lightning Epic](https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/130) to get an overview of the outstanding tickets.
