### Plans ðŸ“†

- Build the trade view based on the [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/zUBJpQ0v8cx6DHivS10OeI/TenTenOneWireFrame) as part of a Flutter app. Flutter allows to us to ship us to multiple devices out of the box.
- Build a Lightning Full node using LDK and Flutter and open a channel automatically [https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/10](https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/10).
- Add a custom output to a Lightning Channel. This will be the base for adding DLCs to a channel. [https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/54](https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/54)

### Progress âœ…

- Added an on-chain wallet powered by [BDK](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk) to our app. We generate a wallet basde on a Bip39 seed phrase [https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/68](https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/68).
- Made progress on our fork of [rust-lightning](https://github.com/itchysats/rust-lightning). We have a full end-to-end test which adds a custom output to the commit transaction. This is the first step to having DLCs on Lightning ðŸš€ðŸŒ•
- Set up Flutter and `flutter-rust-bridge` so we can stick to rust for the beefy parts but have a beautiful cross-platform app based on Flutter.
- Show balance in the wallet screen. [https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/90](https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/90).
- Work on the Wallet backup screens. [https://github.com/itchysats/10101/pull/81](https://github.com/itchysats/10101/pull/81)
- Work on navigation between Wallet and CFD trading page. [https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/90](https://github.com/itchysats/10101/issues/96).

### Problems âœ‹

- Not a real problem but additional work: we forgot to plan in that we will have to build a lightning node for a server as well. This node will be the default one every user will connect to and act as the counterparty for all trades at the beginning.
