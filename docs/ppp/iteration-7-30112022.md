### Plans ðŸ“†

We are pleased that the judges found our project worthy and are pumped to get one more week of hacking in before the final pitch day!
For this, we decided to mostly work on UX improvements and get our App into Apple's Testflight and an app store for Android.

A few things on our todo list for this week are:

- Persist lightning payment and bitcoin transaction history
- Small UI changes
- Simplify on-boarding by funding the app through our own faucet
- Show transaction details for Lightning as well as for Bitcoin
- Release version 0.3.0 for Testflight and Android

The main goal of this iteration is to get a usable version out there to on-board early users and collect feedback.
If you are keen, feel free to reach out.
