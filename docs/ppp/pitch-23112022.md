## 10101 - One App, All Things Bitcoin

10101 is a noncustodial Lightning wallet infused with financial services such as CFD trading, savings and betting.

**10101** (speaks, **Ten** **Ten** **One**). One App, All Things Bitcoin!

## Problem & Solution üö®

The world of finance is dominated by centralized players.
We trust them with our hard-earned money only to be disappointed and left with a hole in our pockets.\
MtGox, FTX, BlockFi, Celsius, ... it's not anymore an isolated case, it almost feels like it is the norm.

Bitcoin gave us the right tools already: your keys, your coins.

Following this core principle we are reshaping the world of finance. One App, All things Bitcoin

- A mobile wallet to send and receive bitcoin on-chain and off-chain
- Noncustodial CFD trading built in from the get go: go long on Bitcoin without fearing to lose your money due to an exchange hack
- Noncustodial lending and savings to come later-on
