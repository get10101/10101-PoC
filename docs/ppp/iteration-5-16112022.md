### Plans ðŸ“†

- Create invoices
- Send Payments
- Bug fixing and UX improvements
- Replacing mock data with real data
- Show payment history
- Containerize maker
- Wiring up close (settle) CFD
- Persisting CFDs

### Progress âœ…

- Fund wallet screen
- Setup maker service with ldk integration
- Integrated our custom fork of rust-lightning supporting DLCs (custom outputs)
- Wired up open CFD (still with mock amounts)
- Improved logging
- Started ldk node on the phone
- Open channel with maker
- Fetch bid, ask and index prices from bitmex
- Show history of on-chain transactions

### Problems âœ‹

- When implementing our custom protocol on the LDK which allows us to add DLCs to the channel we accepted one short coming: while a DLC is added, you cannot accept or send a payment. This would break the DLC and would make the outputs unspendable. For the tournament we decided to accept this shortcoming but we will focus on this afterwards.
