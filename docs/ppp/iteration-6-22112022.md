### Plans ðŸ“†

It's going to be a short iteration until Thursday and we are in the final steps polishing our solution. We have planned the following tasks to hand-in a strong candidate to be selected for the final round.

- Publish a blog post about our innovation and value proposition
- Prepare the pitch presentation and video promoting our solution
- Record a demo video showing off CFD trading end to end
- Release version 0.2.0 as an APK downloadable from our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/itchysats/10101/releases)
- Last improvements on UI/UX and bug fixing
- Create Lightning invoices to receive money
- Wiring up CFD settlement

### Progress âœ…

We made big steps towards our 0.2.0 release, which will be a working solution bringing CFD trading to Lightning.

- Send payments via Lightning invoices
- Bug fixing and UX improvements
- Added some basic user input validation
- Added persistence on the phone
- Replacing mock data with real data
- Show payment history for on-chain and off-chain transactions
- Added continuous deployment to our testnet pipeline

### Problems âœ‹

- Not really problems, but limitations due to our prototype version, which limits UX in some places.
